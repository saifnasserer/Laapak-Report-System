# Laapak Report System Backend Integration Steps

## Authentication and Logout Fixes

### 1. Fixed Client Logout Redirect Loop
- Updated client-dashboard.js to use auth-middleware.js for authentication checks
- Modified logout button to use authMiddleware.logout() instead of custom function
- Removed manual redirects after logout (now handled by auth-middleware.js)
- Added proper error logging for authentication failures

### 2. Improved Authentication Flow
- Updated auth-check.js to use authMiddleware for consistent authentication checks
- Added token verification instead of using the non-existent isLoggedIn property
- Enhanced error handling and logging for authentication failures
- Ensured proper redirection to login page when authentication fails

### 3. Client Management API Integration
- Created client management methods in ApiService class:
  - getClients() - Fetches all clients with optional filters
  - getClient() - Fetches a single client by ID
  - createClient() - Creates a new client
  - updateClient() - Updates an existing client
  - deleteClient() - Deletes a client
- Updated clients.js to use these methods for all API operations
- Added fallback to mock data when API calls fail

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- Updated client management UI to display real data from the backend
- Added search functionality with backend filtering
- Implemented client CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Enhanced form validation for client data

## How to Connect with Backend

### Backend API Endpoints
The system connects to these endpoints:
- GET /api/clients - List all clients
- GET /api/clients/:id - Get a specific client
- POST /api/clients - Create a new client
- PUT /api/clients/:id - Update a client
- DELETE /api/clients/:id - Delete a client

### Authentication Endpoints
- POST /api/auth/admin - Admin login
- POST /api/auth/client - Client login
- GET /api/auth/me - Get current user info
- POST /api/reset-password/admin - Reset admin password

### Token Management
- Admin tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage as 'adminToken'
- Client tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage as 'clientToken'
- All API requests include Authorization header with token

## Testing the Integration
1. Start the backend server (Node.js + Express)
2. Navigate to the admin login page
3. Login with admin credentials
4. Test client management functionality
5. Test logout functionality to ensure no redirect loops

## Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify API endpoints are correctly configured
- Ensure auth-middleware.js is loaded before other scripts
- Check token expiration and refresh mechanism
