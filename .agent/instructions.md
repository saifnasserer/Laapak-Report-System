# Agent Instructions

This file contains project-specific instructions and rules for the Antigravity agent.

## Core Rules

- **Always Consider Skills**: Before starting a complex task, check the `.agent/skills/` directory for relevant skills.
- **Proactive /learn Usage**: If a task requires a capability or tool that is not currently available, proactively use the `/learn` skill to search for and install relevant skills from [agentskill.sh](https://agentskill.sh).
- **Follow Skills Guide**: Adhere to the triggers and workflows defined in [SKILLS_GUIDE.md](file:///media/saif/brain/Projects/Laapak-Softwares/Laapak-Report-System/.agent/skills/SKILLS_GUIDE.md).
